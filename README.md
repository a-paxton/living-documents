# Creating living documents and reproducible reports with  R markdown and  Jupyter notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/a-paxton/living-documents)

Curious about how living documents and reproducible
reports could help your research? This repo contains
a workshop walkthrough about how
[R markdown](!https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
and [Jupyter notebooks](!http://jupyter.org/) can
enrich your research workflow.

## What are "living documents" and "reproducible reports"?

While everyone seems to have their own take on what
these two terms mean and how they differ from one
another, "living documents" and "reproducible reports"
are ways for researchers to share code, images, and
text in a single document.

For my part, I view "living documents" as
work-in-progress documents. They're great for keeping
notes on your data cleaning, data processing, and
data analysis by allowing you to add plain text,
plots, and live code in a single place. As
researchers, we might spend months away from
a project (while we're busy with something else or
while we're waiting for reviewers to get back to
us). When it comes time to start up the project
again, living documents can help us jump back into
the project quickly: Taking good notes about
what our code does -- right next to real
code -- can help us remember exactly what we were
thinking and why we made the choices we did.

"Reproducible reports," on the other hand, I see
as documents that are meant to publicly accompany
your research outputs (e.g., talks, posters,
journal articles). These are ways for other
researchers (and maybe even your reviewers) to
see all of the work that you did when handling
your data and creating your analyses. Given
ongoing concerns about transparency and
reproducibility in a variety of fields (including
psychology and cognitive science), using
reproducible reports can provide vital information
about the data cleaning, processing, and
analysis that supported your conclusions.

## Why should I care?

### For science

Researchers -- especially within cognitive
science and psychology -- are increasingly
interested in promoting transparency and
reproducibility. There are [badges
that researchers can earn for sharing their
data and materials]
(!https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/)
that promote the prominence of open science,
and some journals even require data and
code sharing now.

Providing an explicit accounting of your data and
code practices can help demonstrate the value of
your work. As an added bonus, if there's future
interest in replicating your work, providing
your code openly can help those future replication
efforts use methods as close to your original
work as possible.

### For your sanity

Think of this as your present self doing something
nice for your future self. If your present self
takes a few minutes to add some explanatory text,
code comments, or a useful plot, you'll be saving
your future self headaches and time. Present-you
knows what you're doing because present-you is
ankle-deep in things. Future-you, on the other
hand, will probably have spent weeks or months
away from the problem and will have to spend
valuable time puzzling through the traces that
then-past-you created. Do future-you a favor!

### The bottom line

A transformative way to think about this is
to see that the effort you put in for helping
your future self can be equally valuable for
helping the broader research community
engage with and make sense of your research.

With just a little bit of additional effort,
you can tweak your living documents into
reproducible reports. If you're taking good
notes and adding comments to your code in
your living document *while* you're doing
the research, all you need to do is publish
the document after you're done!

The beauty of R markdown and Juptyer notebooks lies
in their flexibility -- so experiment until you
find what works best for you!
