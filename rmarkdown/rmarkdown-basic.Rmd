This is an example R markdown file, created as part of the living documents and
reproducible reports workshop. It is primarily the basic R markdown template
(generated automatically upon the creation of a new .Rmd file), with some 
additional commentary and resources.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button (at the top of the RStudio source window), a
document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of
any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk
like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot. There are many other chunk
parameters that permit a variety of chunk behavior. An overview for many of the
most common chunk parameters is available in one of 
[RStudio's R markdown lessons](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html); a
comprehensive list of chunk parameters is available in 
[RStudio's R markdown reference guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

## Running individual chunks

In addition to compiling and running the entire `.Rmd` file with the **Knit**
button, you can also run individual chunks of code by pressing the green "play"
button in the top-right corner of the chunk in the source pane. You can quickly
run all of the code before a given chunk by pressing the icon with a downward-facing
grey arrow above a green bar, to the immediate left of the "play" button.
